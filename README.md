Elements, A PHP Microframework
======

###### Code in harmony using this six-file PHP framework as your best friend.

Inspired by the fullscreen Friendship Is Magic banner that was at the top of every page on [php.net](http://php.net) for a short while, this is a lightweight, easy-to-use framework that finally combines the worlds of PHP and ponies.

Everything you'll need is provided as modules:

elements/twilightsparkle.php
---
A magical database abstraction layer that enables you to create models with ease.

elements/pinkiepie.php
---
Having a problem routing your URLs? Use this regular expression-based module and now you'll have two problems.

elements/rainbowdash.php
---
Fill your pages with jQuery animations. It'll be totally awesome.

elements/rarity.php
---
A simple templating toolkit for stitching your HTML pages together.

elements/applejack.php
---
Security and validation functions. Not a lot of people seem to use this one.

elements/fluttershy.php
---
Tame the chaos with this cookie-based user storage library. Remember, you can always trust the user!
